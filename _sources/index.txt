About Nornir
------------

Nornir's mission is to take large sets of overlapping images in 2D and 3D and produce registered (a.k.a. aligned) 3D volumes of any size and scale.  

History
-------

Nornir evolved from a collaboration between the `Marc Lab`_ and the `Scientific Computing Institute's`_ Tasdizen and Whitaker groups at the University of Utah.  The original tools, known as the `NCR Toolset`_ were used to construct `RC1`_, a 250um diameter, 33um tall cylinder of rabbit retina at a resoultion of 2.18 nm/pixel.   

Nornir is a work in progress.  It currently supports importing images from transmission electron microscopes running SerialEM (.idoc files), light microscopes running Surveyor (.pmg files), and other volumes represented with a single image per section (.png files).

Related Tools
-------------

Volume images frequently exceed the reasonable sizes for single images.  `Viking`_ is another Marc lab tool for viewing and annotating huge datasets.  Nornir produces volumes that can be viewed using Viking if placed on a web server.

Analysis of the annotations created by Viking for our existing rabbit connectome and future connectomes is performed by the `py-connectome-analysis`_ package
